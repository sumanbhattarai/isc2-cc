# 🏹 Incident Response

## 🚨 Build an Incident Response Program

While organizations strive to protect their systems from cybersecurity threats, **incidents are still inevitable**. A well-structured **Incident Response (IR) plan** ensures that an organization can respond effectively when a security breach occurs.

### 📜 **NIST Incident Response Framework**

A widely recognized standard for incident response is **NIST Special Publication 800-61**, the **Computer Security Incident Handling Guide**. This guide outlines a structured approach to incident response and is used across the cybersecurity industry.

### 🏗️ **Key Components of an Incident Response Plan**

A **formalized IR plan** provides structure and ensures **good decision-making** under pressure. It should include:

1. **📌 Statement of Purpose & Scope**

   - Defines **why** the organization is developing the plan.
   - Specifies the **types of incidents covered** (e.g., cybersecurity incidents, data breaches, insider threats).

2. **🎯 Strategies & Goals**

   - Prioritizes response actions (e.g., **containment vs. evidence preservation**).
   - Aligns **business objectives** with security response.

3. **👥 Roles & Responsibilities**

   - Identifies **who** handles incidents and what **authority** they have.
   - Ensures a **clear chain of command**.

4. **📢 Communication Plan**

   - Outlines **internal and external** communication strategies.
   - Defines **escalation procedures** and **third-party notifications**.

5. **✅ Senior Management Approval**
   - Provides **executive buy-in** for critical response actions.
   - Helps enforce security measures even when they are **unpopular** (e.g., disconnecting critical systems).

### 📖 **Leveraging Existing IR Plans**

Instead of **reinventing the wheel**, organizations can reference **existing** IR plans:

- **Carnegie Mellon University** provides a detailed cybersecurity IR plan.
- **State of Oregon’s IR plan template** offers a customizable framework.

### 🔑 **Key Takeaways**

🔹 **Not all team members will be involved in every incident**, but they should be **trained and ready** to participate when needed.

### 🏋️ **Training & Readiness**

- **Distribute** the **Incident Response Plan** to all team members.
- **Conduct regular training** to simulate real-world incidents.
- **Perform periodic testing** to ensure the team can react **quickly and efficiently**.

### 🔍 **External Support & Third-Party Providers**

If the organization lacks certain **forensic or incident response capabilities**, consider **pre-arranging contracts** with **external providers**.

🚨 **Key Tip:**  
❌ **Don’t wait until an incident occurs** to find and negotiate with an external response team.  
✅ **Plan ahead** to ensure **immediate access** to external expertise.

### 🔑 **Key Takeaways**

| **Action**                       | **Purpose**                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Assemble a diverse team**      | Ensures comprehensive incident handling.    |

## 📢 Incident Communications Plan

A **well-defined communications plan** is a critical component of incident response, ensuring **timely and secure communication** both **internally** and **externally** while protecting sensitive information.

### 🔄 **Internal Communication & Escalation**

An **incident notification and escalation procedure** ensures that **the right people** receive **the right information at the right time**.

✅ **Key Considerations:**

- Clearly define **who** needs to be notified at each stage.
- Establish **secure** communication channels to prevent leaks.
- Maintain **incident confidentiality** to avoid tipping off attackers.

### 🌍 **External Communication & Media Management**

External communication is **tricky** and must be **carefully controlled** to protect the organization’s reputation and security.

⚠️ **Risks of Uncontrolled Information Release:**

- The incident may become public **before PR teams** can respond.
- Attackers may be alerted that the breach has been detected.
- Investigation integrity may be **compromised**.

✅ **Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Limit sensitive details** to **trusted** third parties.
- Involve **public relations (PR) teams** for media statements.
- **Pre-approve** spokespersons who can handle external inquiries.

### 🚔 **Law Enforcement & Legal Considerations**

In **most cases, organizations are not legally required** to report security incidents to law enforcement. However, reporting has **implications:**

| **Factor**                  | **Impact**                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Exposure**         | Law enforcement reports **may become public**.                   |
| **Investigation Standards** | Officials must **follow strict evidence collection** procedures. |
| **Legal Obligations**       | Some incidents **must** be reported under privacy laws.          |

**🚨 Contact Law Enforcement If:**

- **There is a threat to safety.**
- **You are legally required** to report the incident.

💼 **Consult your legal team** for guidance on laws and regulations that require notifications to:

- Government agencies
- Private regulatory bodies

| **Use secure communication channels** | Prevents leaks and unauthorized access to incident details.         |

🚀 **A well-planned communications strategy is vital for incident response success!** 🔐

## 🚨 Incident Identification

Once an **incident response plan** is in place, **continuous monitoring** is crucial to detect potential security threats **before** they cause significant damage.

### 🔍 **Sources of Incident Detection**

Organizations rely on multiple security data sources to identify incidents:

✅ **Automated Security Monitoring:**

- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
- **Firewalls & Network Security Tools**
- **Authentication & Access Control Logs**
- **System & File Integrity Monitoring**
- **Vulnerability Scanners**
- **Antimalware & Endpoint Protection**
- **System Event Logs & NetFlow Data**

📊 **SIEM Systems (Security Information & Event Management)** play a key role by:

- **Collecting & Correlating Security Logs**
- **Detecting Incidents with Rules & AI Algorithms**
- **Providing Centralized Investigation Data**

### 🚨 **External Incident Reports**

While automated systems **should** detect threats, sometimes incidents are first reported by **employees, customers, or external organizations.**

⚠️ Examples of External Incident Indicators:

- A **customer finds personal data** leaked online.
- A **corporate system is caught attacking** external sites (e.g., botnet infection).
- An **employee notices unauthorized account access**.

✅ **Incident Response Teams** must have a **structured process** to receive, log, and analyze external reports effectively.

### 🚑 **First Responder Responsibilities**

The **first person to detect an incident** plays a **crucial role** in minimizing damage.

🛑 **Immediate Action: Contain the Threat**

1. **Identify compromised systems**
2. **Isolate affected devices** to prevent further spread
3. **Maintain system integrity** (if needed for forensic analysis)

⛔ **Best Practice:** **Do not shut down a compromised system immediately!**  
Instead, isolate it from the network to prevent attackers from detecting the response.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
The **highest priority** of an incident first responder is **damage containment** to protect the organization. 🚀
