## 🚨 Confidentiality Threats & Solutions

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Threats:**

- **🔍 Snooping** – Unauthorized access to someone’s data, files, or communications, often by an insider or hacker looking for sensitive information.
- **🗑️ Dumpster Diving** – Searching through trash or discarded materials to find confidential information like passwords, financial records, or company data.
- **🎧 Eavesdropping** – Secretly listening to private conversations, either in-person or through electronic means, to gather sensitive information.
- **📞 Wiretapping** – Intercepting and monitoring telephone or network communications to capture conversations or data, often illegally.
- **🎭 Social Engineering** – Manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often through deception or psychological tactics.

### 🛡️ **Solutions:**

- **🔐 Snooping** – **Use encryption** for data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access. Also, clean your work desk before leaving.
- **🗑️ Dumpster Diving** – **Shred documents** before disposal and implement secure disposal methods for sensitive materials.
- **🎧 Eavesdropping** – Use **end-to-end encryption** for communications and avoid discussing sensitive information in public or over unsecured channels.
