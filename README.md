# ⚖️ CIA Triad: The Three Pillars of Cybersecurity

![CIA Triad](./cia.png)

**CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, which are the three core principles of cybersecurity:

- **🔏 Confidentiality** – Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized users and protects it from unauthorized access.
- **🛡️ Integrity** – Ensures the accuracy and reliability of data by preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **⚡ Availability** – Ensures that systems, networks, and data are accessible and operational when needed.

## 🚨 Confidentiality Threats & Solutions

- **🔍 Snooping** – Unauthorized access to someone’s data, files, or communications, often by an insider or hacker looking for sensitive information.  
  💡 **Example:** An employee accesses confidential client data without permission to sell it to a competitor.  
  ✅ **Solution:** **Use encryption** for data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access. Also, clean your work desk before leaving.

- **🗑️ Dumpster Diving** – Searching through trash or discarded materials to find confidential information like passwords, financial records, or company data.  
  💡 **Example:** A hacker finds old bank statements and password lists in the company's dumpster and uses them for identity theft.  
  ✅ **Solution:** **Shred documents** before disposal and implement secure disposal methods for sensitive materials.

- **🎧 Eavesdropping** – Secretly listening to private conversations, either in-person or through electronic means, to gather sensitive information.  
  💡 **Example:** A cybercriminal intercepts a conversation over an unsecured Wi-Fi network to steal login credentials.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Use **end-to-end encryption** for communications and avoid discussing sensitive information in public or over unsecured channels.

- **📞 Wiretapping** – Intercepting and monitoring telephone or network communications to capture conversations or data, often illegally.  
  💡 **Example:** An attacker listens to phone conversations between a CEO and an investor to steal confidential business plans.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Implement **network encryption (e.g., VPN, TLS)** and regularly monitor for unauthorized network taps.

- **🎭 Social Engineering** – Manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often through deception or psychological tactics.  
  💡 **Example:** A hacker impersonates an IT technician and tricks an employee into revealing their password via email.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Conduct **security awareness training** to educate employees on recognizing and resisting manipulation tactics.

## 🔐 Integrity Concerns & Solutions

- **❌ Unauthorized Modification** – Illegitimate changes to data that compromise its accuracy and reliability.  
  💡 **Example:** A hacker alters transaction records in a bank's database to steal funds while disguising the fraudulent activity.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Implement **access controls**, use **hashing (SHA-256, MD5)**, and enable **version control** to track changes.

- **🕵️‍♂️ Impersonation** – An attacker pretends to be a legitimate user to manipulate or alter data.  
  💡 **Example:** An attacker steals login credentials to impersonate a system administrator and changes user permissions to gain unauthorized access.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, enforce **strong password policies**, and monitor for suspicious login attempts.

- **🖥️ Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack** – An attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.  
  💡 **Example:** A hacker intercepts login credentials between a user and a website by exploiting an unsecured Wi-Fi network.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Use **end-to-end encryption (TLS, HTTPS)**, enforce **certificate pinning**, and implement **secure network protocols**.

- **🔁 Replay Attack** – An attacker captures and reuses valid data transmission (e.g., login requests) to gain unauthorized access.  
  💡 **Example:** An attacker captures a user’s login session and replays it later to access the user’s account without their permission.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Implement **timestamps**, use **one-time tokens (OTPs)**, and enforce **session expiration policies**.

## 🚨 Availability Threats & Solutions

- **💻 DOS (Denial of Service)** – An attack that prevents legitimate users from accessing a system or service by overwhelming it with traffic.  
  💡 **Example:** A DDoS attack floods a website with traffic, causing it to crash and making it unavailable for users.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Use **rate limiting**, implement **firewalls**, and set up **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** to detect and block malicious traffic.

- **🖥️ Hardware Failure** – Physical failure of a device or component, such as a hard drive, server, or network equipment, causing downtime.

  ✅ **Solution:** Use **multi-cloud providers**, implement **failover systems**, and ensure **service level agreements (SLAs)** are in place with providers.

# 🛡️ Security Fundamentals: Access Control, Authentication, Privacy, and Password Management

## Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

In the context of cybersecurity, **Identification**, **Authentication**, and **Authorization** are crucial concepts to ensure secure access to systems and data. Below is the explanation of each concept, along with both physical world and tech world scenarios for better understanding.

### 1. Identification 🆔

Identification is the process of claiming an identity. It is the first step in an access control system, where a user presents a credential (e.g., username, ID number) to prove who they are.

**💡 Example in the Physical World:**

Imagine you're going to a bank. The first thing the bank teller asks is for your **ID card**. You present your ID to **identify** yourself as a customer of the bank.

**🤖 Example in the Tech World:**

When you log into a website or an application, you are asked to provide your **username** or **email address**. This is the **identification** process where the system is trying to identify you as a user in its database. This could also be the case when you use **biometric scanners** on your phone to identify yourself by face or fingerprint.

### 2. Authentication 🔑

Authentication is the process of verifying that the identity claimed during the identification process is valid. This can involve something the user knows (password), something they have (token, smartphone), or something they are (biometric data).

**💡 Example in the Physical World:**

After presenting your **ID card** (identification), the bank teller asks you to **enter your PIN** or **provide a signature**. This is the **authentication** process where the bank ensures that you are the rightful owner of the account.

**🤖 Example in the Tech World:**

In the tech world, after providing your **username**, the system will prompt you for your **password**. This process ensures that the person trying to log in is the legitimate user. If two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled, you may be required to enter a **one-time code** sent to your phone or email, adding an extra layer of **authentication**.

### 3. Authorization 🛂

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to a system or resource based on the authenticated identity. It determines what actions a user can perform on the system, such as read, write, or delete data.

**💡 Example in the Physical World:**

After you are authenticated (with your **PIN** or **signature** at the bank), the bank teller will check your **account type** and grant you the appropriate access. For example, if you have a **savings account**, you might be authorized to withdraw money, but if you have a **checking account**, you might also be able to write checks. This is where the bank determines your **authorization** to perform specific actions based on your account type.

**🤖 Example in the Tech World:**

In a web application, once you’ve successfully logged in (authenticated), your account type (admin, user, guest, etc.) is checked to determine what actions you're allowed to perform. For example, a **regular user** may only be able to view data, while an **admin user** has permission to update or delete records. Access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access control (RBAC) are used to manage **authorization** in systems.

## 🛡️ Password Security

### 🔑 **Password Policy Controls**

When setting a password policy for your organization, consider the following technical controls to enhance security:

#### 1. **Password Length** 📏

- **Minimum character length** (recommended: at least **8 characters**).
- Longer passwords are more secure and harder to guess.

#### 2. **Password Complexity** 🔠

- Require different **character types**:
  - **Uppercase** and **lowercase letters**
  - **Digits**
  - **Special characters** (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
- More character types = stronger password

#### 3. **Password Expiration** ⏳

- Force users to change passwords periodically (e.g., every **180 days**).
- Some organizations no longer enforce expiration and allow passwords to stay unless compromised.

#### 4. **Password History** 🕒

- Prevent users from **reusing old passwords**.
- Configure systems to remember previous passwords and block reuse.

#### 5. **Password Reset Process** 🔄

- Ensure a **quick and secure password change process** for users.
- Avoid weak reset mechanisms that could allow unauthorized access.

### 🔐 **Password Management Best Practices**

#### 6. **Avoid Password Reuse** 🔄

- **Discourage password reuse** across multiple sites.
- If a site is compromised, reused passwords could allow attackers to access other accounts.

#### 7. **Use Password Managers** 🧳

- **Password managers** securely store and create **unique passwords** for each site.
- Protect password managers with **biometric security** mechanisms (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).
- Allow users to store passwords securely without needing to memorize them.

### 📌 **Summary of Key Points**

- **Longer and more complex passwords** are harder to guess.
- **Periodic password changes** (or on suspicion of compromise) help enhance security.
- **Password managers** help manage unique passwords without the need to remember each one.
- **Avoid password reuse** to prevent attackers from exploiting compromises.

## 🔐 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

### 🎭 **Understanding Authentication Factors**

Computer systems use different authentication techniques to verify user identities. These techniques fall into three categories:

#### 1️⃣ **Something You Know** 🧠

- A **knowledge-based factor** that relies on information the user remembers.
- Examples:
  - **Passwords** (most common)
  - **PINs (Personal Identification Numbers)**
  - **Security Questions**

#### 2️⃣ **Something You Are** 🧬

- A **biometric factor** that uses physical or behavioral characteristics.
- Examples:
  - **Fingerprint** scanning
  - **Facial recognition**
  - **Voice recognition**

#### 3️⃣ **Something You Have** 📱

- A **possession-based factor** requiring a physical device.
- Examples:
  - **Smartphones** running authentication apps
  - **Security key fobs**
  - **Smart cards**

### 🔑 **Why MFA is Important?**

Each authentication factor has vulnerabilities:

- **Passwords can be stolen** via phishing or brute-force attacks.
- **Biometric data can be spoofed** or fail under certain conditions.
- **Physical devices can be lost** or stolen.

By combining at least **two different factors**, MFA significantly improves security.

### 🛡️ **Multifactor Authentication (MFA) in Action**

- Using a **password + security key** 🔐 (Something You Know + Something You Have)
- **Fingerprint scan + PIN** 🔏 (Something You Are + Something You Know)
- **Smart card + facial recognition** 🏦 (Something You Have + Something You Are)

**🚫 Not MFA:** Combining **two knowledge-based factors** (e.g., password + security question) does not count as MFA.

### 🔄 **Single Sign-On (SSO) Explained**

**SSO (Single Sign-On)** allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without repeated authentication.

- ✅ **Reduces login fatigue** for users.
- ✅ **Improves user experience** and efficiency.
- ✅ **Can be integrated with MFA** for added security.
- ❌ **If compromised, can give attackers broad access** to systems.

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

- MFA **requires at least two different factors** (e.g., something you know & something you have).
- **Passwords + security questions = NOT MFA** (both are knowledge-based).
- **SSO simplifies authentication** but should be paired with **MFA for security**.
- When evaluating MFA on the exam, **ensure the techniques belong to separate factor categories**.

## 📝 Non-Repudiation

### 🔍 **What is Non-Repudiation?**

**Non-repudiation** ensures that an individual **cannot deny** performing a specific action. It provides **verifiable proof** that an action took place.

📌 **Key Concept:**

- **Repudiation** = Denying an action was taken.
- **Non-Repudiation** = Preventing false denials with proof.

### 🎭 **Real-World Example**

Imagine **buying a car** for **$10,000** with just a handshake. Later, the seller might claim you only agreed to pay **$5,000**, or you could deny agreeing at all.

✅ **Solution:** A **signed contract** acts as proof, preventing either party from backing out of the agreement dishonestly.

### 💻 **Tech Example: Digital Signatures**

A company sends a **confidential contract** via email. Later, the sender denies having sent it.

✅ **Solution:** A **digital signature** confirms the sender’s identity and ensures the document wasn’t altered.

### 🛡️ **Non-Repudiation Techniques**

🔏 **Digital Signatures** – Uses **encryption** to verify sender authenticity and prevent document tampering.  
🛂 **Biometric Authentication** – Fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans provide undeniable proof of identity.  
📹 **Video Surveillance** – Captures **physical presence** at a location to prove access or actions.  
📄 **Audit Logs** – Records **timestamped activities** on a system to track user actions.

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

- **Non-repudiation ensures accountability** and prevents false denials.
- **Digital signatures provide cryptographic proof** of authenticity.
- **Audit logs, biometrics, and surveillance add extra layers of proof.**
- **Non-repudiation supports legal and compliance requirements** in security policies.

## 🔒 Privacy

### 🧐 **What is Privacy?**

Privacy refers to the protection of **personal information** collected, stored, and processed by organizations. IT professionals play a key role in safeguarding privacy by:  
1️⃣ Protecting **their own private data**.  
2️⃣ Educating users about privacy risks.  
3️⃣ Assisting **privacy officers** in securing data.

### 🔍 **Types of Private Information**

📌 **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** – Data that can be tied to a specific person (e.g., name, address, Social Security number).  
📌 **Protected Health Information (PHI)** – Healthcare records regulated under **HIPAA** (e.g., medical history, prescriptions).

### ⚖️ **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy**

Privacy is based on the legal principle of **reasonable expectation of privacy**—whether a person **expects** their information to remain private.

📖 **Examples:**

- **Public Posts (No Privacy):** Social media posts are **public** and have **no expectation of privacy**.
- **Private Messages (Some Privacy):** Emails and DMs have **some** expectation of privacy, but they can be intercepted.
- **Government/Health Records (High Privacy):** Personal data given to **tax agencies, banks, and healthcare providers** should be **strictly protected**.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**

An employee **uses a company computer** to send a personal email, assuming it’s private. However, the employer **monitors network activity**, revealing the email.

✅ **Solution:** Employees should be informed that **company-owned systems** generally do **not** provide privacy protection.

### 💻 **Tech Example: Data Breaches**

A **hospital leaks patient records** due to a cyberattack, violating **HIPAA** and patient privacy rights.

✅ **Solution:** Implement **encryption, access controls, and regular audits** to protect sensitive information.

### 🔐 **Best Practices for Privacy Protection**

✅ **Encrypt sensitive communications** (emails, file transfers).  
✅ **Limit access to private data** (only authorized personnel).  
✅ **Educate users about privacy policies** and risks.  
✅ **Use strong authentication** to prevent unauthorized access.  
✅ **Regularly audit systems** for compliance with privacy laws.

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

- **Privacy laws like GDPR and HIPAA** set strict rules for handling personal data.
- **Organizations must protect PII and PHI** from unauthorized access.
- **Company-owned devices and networks are not private**—employers can monitor activity.
- **Encryption and access controls** are essential for privacy protection.

### 📌 **Terms**

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** A regulation in the European Union that mandates strict guidelines for data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU.
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** A U.S. law that ensures the privacy and security of individuals' medical information and sets standards for electronic health transactions.

### ⚠️ **Key Risk Concepts**

To assess risks effectively, it's essential to distinguish between **threats, vulnerabilities, and risks**:

| Term                 | Definition                                                 | Example                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Threat** ⚠️        | An external force that can harm systems.                   | Hackers, hurricanes, malware.                                                  |
| **Threat Vector** 🛠️ | The method an attacker uses to exploit a system.           | Phishing, malware, social engineering.                                         |
| **Vulnerability** 🔓 | A weakness in security controls that a threat can exploit. | Unpatched software, weak passwords.                                            |
| **Risk** 🚨          | The **combination** of a threat and a vulnerability.       | If a new virus is released and your antivirus is outdated, there’s a **risk**. |

**No Risk Exists If Either a Threat or a Vulnerability Is Missing**  
✅ If your building is far from the coast, a **hurricane threat doesn’t apply**.  
✅ If you store backup tapes in a **fireproof safe**, fire isn’t a risk to the data.

### 📌 **Risk Assessment Process**

1️⃣ **Identify Risks** → List out **all** threats, vulnerabilities, and potential risks.  
2️⃣ **Analyze Risks** → Rank risks based on **likelihood** and **impact**.  
3️⃣ **Prioritize Risks** → Focus on risks with the **highest likelihood and impact**.

**🔢 Likelihood vs. Impact Example**

- **Likelihood**: Probability of the risk occurring.
  - Earthquakes are more likely in **California** than in **Wisconsin**.
- **Impact**: Potential damage if the risk occurs.
  - An **earthquake** can destroy a **data center**, while a **rainstorm** might not cause any harm.

### 📈 **Risk Assessment Techniques**

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qualitative** 📝  | Uses **subjective** judgment to classify risks as **low, medium, or high**. | A company ranks **cyberattacks** as **high impact, high probability**.            |
| **Quantitative** 📊 | Uses **numerical** values to measure risk (often in financial terms).       | An **insurance company** calculates the **monetary loss** from a security breach. |

#### 🎯 **Qualitative Risk Assessment Chart**

| Impact            | Low Likelihood | Medium Likelihood | High Likelihood |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Low Impact**    | Low Risk       | Low Risk          | Medium Risk     |
| **Medium Impact** | Low Risk       | Medium Risk       | High Risk       |
| **High Impact**   | Medium Risk    | High Risk         | High Risk       |

📌 A **High Likelihood + High Impact** risk is a **priority**! 🚨

📢 **Note:**

- **CC Exam Focus:** Understand risk concepts & assessment methods.
- **Advanced Certifications (CISSP, etc.):** Cover detailed **quantitative risk calculations**.

### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- **Risk = Threat + Vulnerability**
- **Prioritize risks** by analyzing **likelihood & impact**.
- **Use qualitative** (subjective) **or quantitative** (numerical) **techniques**.
- **High likelihood + high impact** = **highest priority**!

## 🔄 Risk Treatment

Once an organization completes a **risk assessment**, it must decide how to handle each identified risk. **Risk treatment** involves selecting and implementing strategies to control risks effectively.

### 🎯 **Four Risk Treatment Strategies**

Organizations have **four primary options** for managing risks:

| Strategy                 | Description                                                      | Example                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk Avoidance** 🚫    | Eliminating the risk by **changing business practices**.         | Moving a **data center** to a location **without flood risk**.                            |
| **Risk Transference** 🔄 | Shifting the financial impact of the risk to **another entity**. | Purchasing **cyber insurance** to cover financial losses from security breaches.          |
| **Risk Mitigation** 🔧   | Taking **measures to reduce** risk likelihood or impact.         | Installing **flood barriers** to protect a data center.                                   |
| **Risk Acceptance** ✅   | Accepting the risk when **mitigation costs outweigh benefits**.  | Choosing to **keep operations in a flood-prone area** and handling damages if they occur. |

📌 **Note:**

- **Risk transference** (e.g., insurance) does not eliminate reputational damage.
- **Risk acceptance** should only be done after a **thoughtful cost-benefit analysis**.

### 📊 **Understanding Organizational Risk Profiles**

Each organization faces a **unique combination of risks**, known as its **risk profile**. Organizations implement **risk management strategies** to handle these risks.

| Risk Type            | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inherent Risk** 🎭 | The risk level **before any security controls** are in place.                                            |
| **Residual Risk** 🏗️ | The remaining risk **after applying security controls**.                                                 |
| **Control Risk** ⚠️  | The **new risks introduced by security controls**. _(e.g., a firewall reduces risk but may fail itself)_ |

✅ **The goal of risk management** is to ensure that the **combination of residual risk and control risk** remains **below the organization's risk tolerance**.

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

- **Four main risk treatments**: **Avoidance, Transference, Mitigation, and Acceptance**.
- **Risk management is ongoing** and must align with the organization's **risk profile**.
- **Risk controls can introduce new risks**, so organizations must continuously **evaluate and adjust** their risk treatment strategies.

## 🛡️ Selecting Security Controls

Security professionals implement **security controls** to counteract risks identified in **risk assessments**. These controls aim to:

- **Reduce** the likelihood of a security breach.
- **Minimize** the impact if a breach occurs.
- **Detect** security incidents when they happen.

A **real-world analogy** is **home security**, where **locks, alarms, security cameras, and lighting** work together to protect a home.

### 🔁 **Defense-in-Depth Strategy**

Organizations **layer multiple security controls** to **reduce single points of failure**.  
Example:

- If an **alarm system fails**, **security cameras** still provide evidence.

### 🔍 **Categories of Security Controls**

Security controls are categorized based on **purpose** and **mechanism of action**.

### 📌 **1. Purpose-Based Categories**

| Control Type      | Description                                   | Example                                                   |

   - **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)** provide battery backup.
   - **Generators** support long-term power loss.
   - Managed power distribution units, or PDUs, work to manage the power within a rack of servers, ensuring that the power delivered to devices is clean and conditioned

2. **Storage Redundancy (RAID)**

   - **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Writes identical data to two disks; if one fails, the other continues operation.
   - **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):** Spreads data and parity blocks across multiple disks; if one fails, the system reconstructs lost data.
   - ⚠️ **RAID is not a backup strategy!** It prevents single-disk failures but doesn't protect against total system loss.

3. **Network Redundancy**

   - **NIC Teaming:** Uses multiple **network interface cards (NICs)** to ensure connectivity.
   - **Multipath Networking:** Provides redundant paths between servers and storage.
   - **Multiple ISPs:** Ensures connectivity even if one service provider fails.

4. **Technology & Vendor Diversity**
   - Using **different hardware/software vendors** prevents a single flaw from affecting the entire infrastructure.
   - **Diverse cryptographic algorithms** enhance security resilience.

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

| **Strategy**               | **Purpose**                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **High Availability (HA)** | Keeps operations running through system-level redundancy.          |
| **Fault Tolerance (FT)**   | Strengthens critical system components to prevent failures.        |
| **RAID**                   | Protects against disk failures but is **not a backup**.            |
| **Network Redundancy**     | Ensures continuous connectivity.                                   |
