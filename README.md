CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are the three core principles of cybersecurity:

    Confidentiality – Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized users and protects it from unauthorized access.

    Integrity – Ensures the accuracy and reliability of data by preventing unauthorized modifications.

    Availability – Ensures that systems, networks, and data are accessible and operational when needed.

Confidentiality Threats:

- Snopping (Snooping) – Unauthorized access to someone’s data, files, or communications, often by an insider or hacker looking for sensitive information.

- Dumpster Diving – Searching through trash or discarded materials to find confidential information like passwords, financial records, or company data.

- Eavesdropping – Secretly listening to private conversations, either in-person or through electronic means, to gather sensitive information.

- Wiretapping – Intercepting and monitoring telephone or network communications to capture conversations or data, often illegally.

- Social Engineering – Manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often through deception or psychological tactics.
