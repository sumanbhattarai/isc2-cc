# 👥 Social Awareness and Training

## 🎭 Social Engineering

Social engineering is a form of manipulation where attackers exploit **human psychology** rather than technical vulnerabilities to compromise security.

### 🎯 Definition

Social engineering attacks trick people into:

- Disclosing sensitive information
- Granting unauthorized access
- Performing actions that compromise security

It’s essentially **running a con** — digitally or in person.

### 🧠 Psychological Principles Behind Social Engineering

#### 🧑‍⚖️ Authority

- People defer to perceived authority figures.
- Example: A fake executive demands access or issues instructions with confidence and tone of authority.

#### 😨 Intimidation

- Threats, aggressive tone, or fear of consequences.
- Example: “If you don’t reset this password right now, the CEO will fire you.”

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Consensus (Social Proof)

- People follow group behavior.
- Example: “Everyone else approved this install, you’re the last one.”

#### ⏳ Scarcity

- Urgency created by limited availability.
- Example: “This is the last upgraded router — do you want it or should I move on?”

#### ⏱️ Urgency

- Rushes the target into action without thinking.
- Example: “The system will go down if this isn’t fixed in 10 minutes!”

#### 😊 Familiarity / Liking

- Builds trust through friendliness and flattery.
- Example: “Hey, I think we met at last month’s IT mixer!”

### 🛡️ Defense: Security Awareness

The best protection against social engineering is **user education**.

#### Teach users to:

- **Verify** identities before granting access or information
- Be **skeptical of urgent or pushy requests**
- **Report** suspicious behavior
- Understand that **manipulation tactics** like the six above are commonly used by attackers

> ⚠️ **Wariness is a virtue.** Encourage a healthy level of suspicion in security-sensitive environments.

## 🕵️ Impersonation Attacks

Impersonation attacks are **social engineering tactics** that involve pretending to be someone else — usually someone trusted — to trick individuals into sharing information or performing harmful actions.

### 📬 Spam and Phishing

#### 🗑️ Spam (Unsolicited Commercial Email or UCE)

- Mass-sent unwanted messages for marketing or fraud.
- Illegal under **CAN-SPAM Act**, but hard to trace offenders.

#### 🎣 Phishing

- A type of spam meant to **steal sensitive information**, like passwords or credit card details.
- Usually involves fake links to **legitimate-looking login pages**.

**Example:**  
"You’ve reached your mailbox storage limit. Click here to upgrade."  
(But the link actually leads to a phishing page.)

> 🔁 **Credential Reuse Danger:**  
> If users reuse passwords across multiple platforms, one stolen login can lead to several account breaches.

### 🎯 Targeted Phishing Variants

#### 🎯 Spear Phishing

- Tailored attacks targeting **specific individuals or small groups**.
- Use company jargon and names to appear legitimate.

#### 📄 Invoice Scams

- Fake invoices sent to finance departments hoping for unverified payments.

#### 🐋 Whaling

- Spear phishing that targets **high-level executives**.
- Often disguised as legal threats or confidential notices.

### 🧪 Advanced Impersonation Techniques

#### 🌐 Pharming

- Fake websites mimic real ones to capture credentials.
- May involve:
  - **Typosquatting**: Using look-alike domains (e.g., go0gle.com)
  - **DNS poisoning**: Redirecting users to malicious sites automatically

#### 📞 Vishing (Voice Phishing)

- Attackers **call** targets pretending to be IT/helpdesk or vendors.
- May ask for passwords, or to install “security tools.”

#### 💬 Smishing (SMS Phishing)

- Spam or phishing via text or messaging apps (SMS, iMessage).
- Originated as SPIM (Spam over IM).

### 👻 Spoofing

- **Faking identity** in emails, phone calls, or SMS.
- Email spoofing: Attackers send messages from fake "trusted" addresses.
- Caller ID and SMS spoofing also possible with simple software.

### 🛡️ Defense: Education is Key

- **Phishing only needs one victim to succeed.**
- Teach users to:
  - Verify requests before acting
  - Be skeptical of **urgent or emotional messages**
  - Check URLs carefully
  - Report suspicious communications immediately

> 🎓 Regular awareness training is the best defense against impersonation attacks.

## 🧠 Security Awareness Training

Security awareness training is essential because even the most robust technical controls can be **undermined by human error**. A single accidental or intentional misstep can expose an organization to significant risk. Security education equips users with knowledge and habits to protect against such threats.

### 🎓 Components of Security Education

#### 🛡️ Security Training

- **In-depth instruction** that imparts necessary knowledge.
- Delivered through:
  - Classroom sessions
  - Online courses
  - New employee orientations
  - Vendor-sponsored programs

#### 🔁 Security Awareness

- **Ongoing reinforcement** of previously learned lessons.
- Delivered via:
  - Posters
  - Videos
  - Email reminders
  - Digital signage
- Keeps security **top-of-mind** without requiring formal learning time.

### 📦 Delivery Methods and Examples

#### SANS Institute – EndUser Security Awareness Training

- Customizable online training on wide security topics.
- Organizations can assign tailored modules based on employee roles or compliance requirements.

#### Cofense PhishMe

- **Simulated phishing attacks** sent to users.
- Those who fall for the simulation are redirected to training materials.
- Backend reporting helps measure training effectiveness and track improvement over time.

#### Other Techniques

- **Gamification**: Makes training engaging and interactive.
- **Capture the Flag (CTF)**: Challenges users with realistic scenarios to practice defending against threats.
- **Phishing Simulations**: Regularly test and educate users through fake phishing attempts.

### 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Training

Different roles require different training content:

| Role                 | Training Focus                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| General Employees    | Phishing, password hygiene, secure browsing  |
| HR Staff             | Handling PII (personally identifiable info)  |
| Finance & Accounting | Invoice fraud, wire transfer scams           |
| IT & Security Teams  | Secure configuration, system hardening, logs |
| Developers           | Secure coding practices, OWASP Top 10        |
| Customer Support     | Social engineering awareness                 |

### 🗓️ Training Frequency

- **Initial Training**: Upon hire or job role change.
- **Annual Refresher**: Reinforce existing material and update with new threats.
- **Ongoing Awareness**: Posters, newsletters, and in-the-moment reminders year-round.

> 💡 Tip: Keep the program flexible and evolving to respond to new threat landscapes and business changes.

### 🛠️ Program Maintenance

- Regularly review and update training materials.
- Incorporate **new threat intelligence**, changing compliance requirements, and lessons learned from incidents.

> 🔄 **Effective training is not a one-time event — it’s an ongoing process of engagement, education, and evaluation.**
