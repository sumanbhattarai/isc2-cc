# 💥 Disaster Recovery

## 🌪️ Disaster Recovery Planning

Disaster recovery (DR) is a **critical subset** of business continuity planning (BCP) focused on **restoring normal operations** after a disaster.

### 🔥 **What Triggers a Disaster Recovery Plan?**

A **disaster** can be caused by various **internal or external** events:

🔹 **Natural Disasters** – Hurricanes, earthquakes, floods  
🔹 **Manmade Disasters** – Cyberattacks, data breaches, power outages  
🔹 **Internal Failures** – Server crashes, database corruption

📌 **Key Goal:** **Recognize the disaster quickly** and **activate** the DR plan.

### 🚑 **Initial Response & Containment**

When a disaster strikes, the first step is to:

✔️ **Minimize damage** to systems and data  
✔️ **Restore temporary operations** (e.g., using a backup data center)  
✔️ **Engage third-party recovery services** if needed

⏳ **During a disaster, employees may take on temporary roles.**  
**Flexibility and rapid adaptation** are crucial.

### 📡 **Communication During Disaster Recovery**

💬 **Reliable communication channels** must be in place to:

- Activate the **disaster recovery** process (even after hours)
- Provide **regular status updates** to teams & leadership
- Enable **ad hoc tactical coordination**

Secure messaging tools should be **pre-planned** to ensure connectivity even if primary networks fail.

### 📊 **Key Disaster Recovery Metrics**

Three critical metrics help **define recovery objectives**:

📌 **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**  
🕒 Maximum **time allowed** to restore a system/service.

📌 **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**  
📅 **Maximum data loss** acceptable (e.g., last 4 hours of transactions).

📌 **Recovery Service Level (RSL):**  
📈 **Minimum service level** required (e.g., 50% of website capacity).

These metrics **guide DR planners** to balance recovery speed and operational impact.

### 🔄 **Execution & Full Recovery**

1️⃣ **Assess the Damage** 🛠️  
2️⃣ **Implement Temporary Solutions** 🚧  
3️⃣ **Execute Full Restoration** 🚀

📌 **The DR effort is only complete when the organization returns to its primary environment.**

### 🎯 **Training & Awareness**

🔹 **Periodic Training:** Staff should know their DR responsibilities.  
🔹 **Frequent Awareness Programs:** Keep DR readiness **top of mind**.

✅ **A well-prepared team ensures a swift and efficient recovery!** 🚀

## 💾 Backups

Backups are **the most important** part of a **disaster recovery plan** because they provide a fail-safe way to recover **critical business data** after:

- **Technology failures** (e.g., server crashes)
- **Human errors** (e.g., accidental deletions)
- **Natural disasters** (e.g., floods, fires)
- **Cyberattacks** (e.g., ransomware, data breaches)

📌 **Without backups, data loss could be catastrophic!** 🚨

### 🔄 **Backup Storage Methods**

Organizations use various backup storage techniques:

📂 **Manual Copying** – Basic but error-prone  
📼 **Tape Backups** – Reliable but difficult to manage  
💽 **Disk-to-Disk Backups** – Faster restores, often stored off-site  
🌐 **Network Storage (SAN/NAS)** – Centralized backup storage  
☁️ **Cloud Backups (AWS, Azure, GCP)** – Geographically distributed, highly redundant

📌 **Modern organizations prefer cloud-based backups** for **scalability, redundancy, and security**.

### 📸 **Types of Backups**

1️⃣ **Full Backup** – Copies **everything** from the source.  
 ✔️ **Pros:** Complete recovery from a single backup.  
 ❌ **Cons:** Requires **more storage & time**.

2️⃣ **Differential Backup** – Backs up **all changes** since the last **full backup**.  
 ✔️ **Pros:** Faster restore than incremental backups.  
 ❌ **Cons:** Grows larger over time.

3️⃣ **Incremental Backup** – Backs up **only changes** since the last **full or incremental backup**.  
 ✔️ **Pros:** Saves storage space.  
 ❌ **Cons:** **Slower restore** since multiple backups must be applied sequentially.

### 📊 **Backup Strategy Example**

Joe, a **storage administrator**, follows this backup schedule:

- **Sunday:** Full backup 🗂️
- **Monday–Thursday:** Differential or Incremental backups

#### 🔁 **Scenario 1: Using Differential Backups**

🛠️ **System failure on Friday morning**  
🔹 Restore **Sunday’s full backup**  
🔹 Restore **Thursday’s differential backup** (contains all changes since Sunday)

✅ **Faster restore process!**

#### 🔁 **Scenario 2: Using Incremental Backups**

🛠️ **System failure on Friday morning**  
🔹 Restore **Sunday’s full backup**  
🔹 Apply **Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday incremental backups** sequentially

✅ **Saves storage space but takes longer to restore!**

### 🎯 **Choosing the Right Backup Strategy**

📌 **For faster restores:** Use **Differential Backups**  
📌 **For lower storage usage:** Use **Incremental Backups**  
📌 **For complete protection:** Combine **Full + Differential + Cloud Backups**

### 🔐 **Best Practices for Data Backups**

✔️ **Follow the 3-2-1 Rule**

- **3 copies** of data
- **2 different storage types**
- **1 copy offsite (cloud or remote location)**

✔️ **Automate backups** to prevent human error  
✔️ **Encrypt** backups to protect sensitive data  
✔️ **Test restores regularly** to ensure backups are functional

🚀 **A well-planned backup strategy ensures quick recovery and business continuity!**

## 🏢 Disaster Recovery Sites

Organizations use **Disaster Recovery (DR) Sites** to shift computing functions when their **primary data center** becomes unavailable due to a disaster. These sites serve as alternate processing facilities to **minimize downtime and ensure business continuity**.

### 🔥 **Types of Disaster Recovery Sites**

| Site Type        | Setup                                                       | Cost             | Recovery Time        | Key Features                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hot Site** 🔴  | Fully operational with **all data & hardware**              | $$$$ (Very High) | **Minutes to Hours** | Runs in parallel to the primary site, **can activate automatically** |
| **Warm Site** 🟠 | **Hardware & software available**, but not actively running | $$ (Moderate)    | **Hours to Days**    | Needs some configuration before going live                           |
| **Cold Site** 🔵 | **Basic infrastructure only** (no servers, no data)         | $ (Low)          | **Weeks to Months**  | Requires setup & hardware installation before use                    |

📌 **Hot Sites** provide the fastest recovery but are the most expensive.  
📌 **Cold Sites** are cost-effective but require extensive setup time.  
📌 **Warm Sites** balance cost and recovery time.

### 📦 **Backup Storage at DR Sites**

Disaster Recovery Sites also serve as **offsite storage** locations for **business data backups**. To enhance **site resiliency**, organizations use **strategic backup placement**:

- **Offline Backups** 💤 – Stored physically, require manual retrieval, cost-effective.
- **Online Backups** ⚡ – Available instantly, but require higher financial investment.
- **Site Replication** 🔄 – Data is transferred **digitally** to the DR site via **SANs** or **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.

📌 **Geographically distant sites** ensure that the same disaster **doesn’t affect both primary & backup facilities**.

### 📝 **Alternate Business Processes**

In addition to **technical solutions**, businesses may adopt **alternative workflows** to maintain operations:

- 📄 **Paper-based ordering** if the **electronic order system** is down.
- ☎️ **Manual customer service processes** if automated systems fail.
- 🚚 **Alternative supply chain arrangements** in case of logistics failures.

📌 **Flexibility is key** in disaster response planning!

### 🚀 **Key Takeaways**
